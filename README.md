# Material related to the course: "Fluorescence Imaging Analysis: The Case of Calcium Transients" given at the ENP summer school on June 17 2015

In addition to this README file there are two interesting files here:

1. `Pouzat-ENP-2015.org`, the [org](http://orgmode.org/) source file. It contains the text of the slides and the code generating all the figure except one. The code part is not fully documented yet (at the end). =Python= is used for the analysis. The file is a pure =UTF-8= file and you can open it with any editor. The text and code parts are straightforward to identify.
2. `zerosept_vanVliet1998F3.png`, the only figure that is not generated by a computation. It is taken from: L. van Vliet et col. (1998) [Digital Fluorescence Imaging Using Cooled CCD Array Cameras](http://homepage.tudelft.nl/e3q6n/publications/1998/AP98LVDSTY/AP98LVDSTY.html) (figure 3).
